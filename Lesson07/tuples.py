#TUPLES ARE SIMILAR TO LISTS BUt ARE IMMUTIBLE
numbers = (1, 2, 3) #Tuples use parenthesis () and Lists use square brackets []
#numbers[0] =10 # will get an error
print(numbers[2]) #will print the value in position

#Tuples cannot be changed or re-assigned. They only have two methods
# Great for array that shouldn't be changed in program
